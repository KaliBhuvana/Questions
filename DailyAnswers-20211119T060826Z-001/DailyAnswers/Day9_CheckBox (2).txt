1) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?

	Absolute XPath starts from the root node and ends with desired descendant element’s node. It starts with top HTML node and ends with input node. It starts with a single forward slash(/) as shown below.

		Eg: /html/body/div[3]/div[1]/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td/input

	Relative XPath starts from any node in between the HTML page to the current element’s node(last node of the element). It starts with a double forward slash(//) as shown below.

		Eg: //input[@id='email']

2) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "./drivers/chromedriver.exe");
		ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.manage().window().maximize();
		driver.get("http://testleaf.herokuapp.com/pages/checkbox.html");

		boolean selected = driver
				.findElementByXPath("(//label[text()='Confirm Selenium is checked']/following::input)[1]").isSelected();
		if (selected == true) {
			System.out.println("checkbox is checked");
		} else {
			System.out.println("checkbox is not checked");
		}
