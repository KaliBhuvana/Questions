1)What are access modifiers?
	Java provides access control through public, private and protected access modifier keywords. When none of these are used, it’s called default access modifier.
A java class can only have public or default access modifier.

2) Difference between == and .equals() method in Java

	Both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality. But there are certain differences between them.

a) .equals() is a method and == is an operator.
b) == operator is used for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison i.e., == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values in the objects.
c) If a class does not override the equals method, then by default it uses equals(Object o) method of the closest parent class that has overridden this method.

	Eg: 
	public class Test { 
   	 public static void main(String[] args) 
    	{ 
        	String s1 = new String("TEST LEAF"); 
	        String s2 = new String("TEST LEAF"); 
        	System.out.println(s1 == s2); 
	        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); 
	    } 
	}

Output:
	false
	true
